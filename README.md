## Description 

This project will be used for small shops and workshops to manage inventory, invoices, and customers. But before we dive in, let me give you a bit of background about this project:

So, the reason I started this project is that I felt a bit rusty in my coding skills and lacked practice in developing my own ideas. I know this idea isn't the most original out there, I'm well aware of that. But it's one of the best examples to work with when familiarizing myself with a new framework or language.

Now, I don't want to make this personal project too big, but I do want it to be useful (and free for anyone who wants to implement it). I've tried to make it as clear as possible, in case someone wants to add new features. Feel free to fork it and add or modify its functionality.

Let's get to the important part:

This project uses NestJS and therefore TypeScript. The database being used is SQLite (you can change it to any supported by TypeORM).
